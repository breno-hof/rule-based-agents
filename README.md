## control heating

Imagine a simple thermostat that regulates the heating of a room. Your "rules" could be:

If the temperature is below 18°C, turn on the heating.
If the temperature is above 24°C, turn off the heating.
This thermostat is a classic example of a simple rule-based agent, as it only acts according to the current temperature, without storing history or predicting future changes.
